# Subsea Cable Vulnerability Index (SCVI) 3.0

**Objective:** To construct a unified framework that quantifies national digital sovereignty by merging physical infrastructure fragility with geopolitical and operational risks.

---

## The 4 Pillars of Vulnerability (Weight: 25% Each)

### Pillar I: Physical Network Robustness
*Focuses on the mathematical and topological strength of the cable grid.*
- **Route Diversity (HHI):** Measures concentration; high scores indicate a "single point of failure" risk.
- **Node Betweenness Centrality:** Identifies critical "bridge" nations whose disruption impacts global traffic.
- **Algebraic Connectivity:** Uses the Fiedler value to determine how easily a network can be partitioned into isolated islands.

### Pillar II: Geographic & Environmental Exposure
*Focuses on the physical environment where cables are laid.*
- **Chokepoint Dependency:** Vulnerability to narrow maritime passages (e.g., Malacca Strait, Red Sea).
- **Depth Analysis:** Cables in "Shallow Water" (<200m) are at higher risk from fishing and anchors.
- **Conflict Zone Proximity:** Exposure to areas with active naval tensions or high piracy.

### Pillar III: Operational Sovereignty
*Focuses on a nation's ability to maintain and repair its own connectivity.*
- **Sovereign Repair Vessels:** Availability of domestic-flagged ships to perform repairs during crises.
- **Cable Protection Zones (CPZs):** Existence of legal frameworks and exclusion zones to prevent accidental damage.
- **Repair Latency:** Estimated time to fix a break based on ship proximity and permitting speed.

### Pillar IV: Geopolitical & Ownership Security
*Focuses on the influence of foreign actors and corporate entities.*
- **Ownership Diversity:** Reliance on "Hyperscalers" (Google, Meta, Amazon) vs. local/state entities.
- **Transit State Alignment:** Measures the political "friction" of cables passing through foreign EEZs.
- **UN Voting Alignment:** Uses diplomatic data to weigh the risk of a transit state interfering with cable operations.
